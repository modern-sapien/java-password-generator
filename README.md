## Introduction

For this project, I was tasked with creating a password generator in javascript that would enable a user through a series of prompts to create a unique randomly generated password.


## Steps Taken

1. I created a series of variables that were reliant on users for data generation. A prompt for password length; followed by confirms for types of characters to be included in the newly generated password.

2. I created an object that stored the strings of characters that a user could pull from to add to their generatedPasssword variable that would contain a new randomized string for every new page submission.

3. Following the series of prompts, the script.js file would run through a series of if & else statements to confirm that what the password generator would include in its randomized character generation & if the user met the criteria of choose a value between 8 & 128 for password length.

4. Using a For Loop statement, a letter would be selected from the string of the generatedPassword variable randomly & create a new variable called randomizedPassString that would then be returned by the randomizedPassString function. 

## Why This is Useful

Javascript is a powerful tool, and these project only scratches the surface of what this flexible tool is capable of using only basic tools to create a useful resource for people. 

## What I Learned

The logic behind your process matters, psuedocoding matters, knowing what your plan is before building a single line of code MATTERS. At the bottom of my page I have the acceptance guideliness commented out & some pseudocode residue from before I properly started the projected. 

Testing and commenting on what you are building also helps others & yourself better understand your process & your path in solving a problem because there are almost infinite ways in solving problems in javascript & comments & console.log() provides a beacon for you to know what is going wrong and what your process is.


## Appreciations

This project would not be possible without time spent in office hours, in virtual study rooms, youtube code personalities and a caveman javascript toolset.
